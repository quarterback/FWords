# FWords

Was addicted to [Wordle](https://powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) and wanted to toss together a quick version & made this is a Finnish language remix of [Worble](https://glitch.com/~worble)

Finnish words pillaged from [this Finnish dictionary](https://github.com/pulmark/finnish-dictionary) originally from the Institute for the languages of Finland. Available under [CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)

You can play it [online.](http://fwords.fakebaseball.xyz/)
