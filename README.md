# FWords

Was addicted to [Wordle](https://powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) and wanted to mess around with a custom version.
Made this is a Finnish language remix of [Worble](https://glitch.com/~worble)
Finnish words pillaged from [this Finnish dictionary](https://github.com/pulmark/finnish-dictionary) originally from the Institute for the languages of Finland at available under [CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)
